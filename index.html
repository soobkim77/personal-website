            <p>Hello all, <br>
                My name is Soo-Beom Kim but most people commonly refer to me as Soob. I was born in South Korea and immigrated as the age of 2. Since then, I have lived in the South Puget Sound area, graduating from Puyallup High School (2016) and the University of Washington (2020). <br>
                As a recent college graduate, I found myself lost at my next steps. Realizing that my Political Science degree had left me limited options, I decided to enroll in a software development course at the Flatiron School. This page will serve as a reminder for where my journey started and hopefully will reflect my growth as time passes.
            </p>
